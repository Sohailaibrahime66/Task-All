1-  The console Will Be "Hello !"
    The value of d.greeting is 'Hello !' because when we do d = c
    we are not copying the object c into d.
    we are copying the reference to the object c into d.
    When we change the property of c, it is change in d as well. 

2-*- The answer will be 50 
    we are actually copying the reference to the first variable into the second variable
    not change the value so the y will be 50


3- -*- The answer Will be 101
    because when we assign in the arrays with index greater than the length of the array, 
    it will be added to the array.and the length of the array is automatically increased to
    new length. as we add index 100 so the lenght of the array is 101.

4- console1: will be 20
    console2: will be non because the this keyword is not bound to the shape object in the arrow function. so it is undefined

5- diff  called before the function is defined, it results in a error

6- will get an object from function

7-number
8-
